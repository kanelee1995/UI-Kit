# Browk UI-Kit
This a UI kit inspired by Michael Browk.
Mainly for portfolio showcase & my own other projects.

### Purpose of this project:

First, it represents my skill to convert a figma design layout into react static / interactive component (whether it is made from scratch or 3rd party)

Second, the process is very much related to real world use case and many tech company has their own UI.

Third, it is more close to a professional front end developer workflow which means I am ready to work.

### Techology used

Figma
Storybook
React-select
